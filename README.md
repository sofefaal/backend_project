# Northcoders News API

Welcome to the NC News, for this project I will be creating an API which mimics a real backend service such as Reddit. 
In order to clone this project down localled you will need to have the following files .env.test and .env.development, in the .env.test file add the following to access the database: PGDATABASE=nc_news_test

For the .env.development file add the following: PGDATABASE=nc_news

You'll also need to run npm install on your terminal.
